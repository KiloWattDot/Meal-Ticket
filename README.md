  ## Description

  Welcome to Meal Ticket!! This website was deployed to Heroku by Code Red Team Members which consists of Terrell Hudson, Chuck Marlow, Yasin Munye, Dorothy Gilchrist & Calvin Turner. Meal Ticket was built on the concept of finding local mom and pop restaurant the picking up or get the food delivered. This webpage does that by searching by zip code, city or address. Each restaurant will populates with the title, rating, number of reviews, price, average cost, address and phone number of the restaurants. There is also a favorites button where you can add your favoraite restaurants for future reference. A menu page has been created to add food items you would like to cart so you could buy it which will display the subtotal of all the items in the cart for checkout.
